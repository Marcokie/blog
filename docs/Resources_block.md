# Doing great work behind the resources iron curtain

"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" Karl Marx the father of communism famously remarked. 
This slogan would apply, he said in a world of abundance where "labour has become not only a means of life but life's prime want".  
	I believe that this world has become a reality in many resource-industry corporate offices, even in very capitalist countries.
These corporate workers certainly live in abundance and I would argue that as far as their labour is concerned, the means have become the end.  
	The distinction between workers in head office and those at the coal face is a lot more pronounced in the resources industry.
"Corporates" dwell in ultra liveable cities, while "Operations" have to put up with the harsh environments of the mine / processing plant / oil rig where the money is generated.[^2]
Operations are kept lean thanks to a share holder cost per ton focus, leaving the "abundance" in the hands of the Corporates.
That is probably true for most industries, but in other industries a lot of the effort of Corporates are directed at keeping customers happy.
Resources companies have few customers with few demands other than on-spec products being delivered on schedule.[^1]
With the two main business outcomes removed as focus, what drives activities / labour then but the "life's prime want" of the participants?[^5]   
	
With Marx's conditions met, these corporate environments foster the same tendencies that were observed in early communist societies.
Big projects with little correlation to the company's success are funded, patronage based empires are built and rivals are "purged" in rounds of lay-offs or "exiled" into dead-end roles.
These tendencies are less pronounced for smaller companies, but they are there.  
	For people educated in technical and financial fields who expect decisions to be made based on facts only, this reality can be jarring. 
The question becomes how to do great work[^3] behind the resources Iron curtain?  
	There are three options:  
1. You can stay in Corporate and "Play the game",
1. You can put your hard hat back on and join the lean Operations side of the business where you can stay clear of corporate politics, or
1. You can "sell shovels" and become a supplier of products or services into the resource industry.  

Playing the corporate game is about winning a popularity contest and that is not conducive to doing great work.
Without backing your projects will be canned, whether they are good or not. 
Like in high school, winning the popularity contents is a full time job and does not leave time for doing great work.  
	But there are more than one game being played in Corporate.
The power game is the game won by the Stalins of the world.
One can play a knowledge game as well, which is less volatile.
To play this game you need to be perceived as both "harmless" and a "safe pair of hands".
	What about the hard hat?  
	I believe you can do great work of the "run a tight ship" variety in Operations.
The top job, site manager, places an upper limit to ambition for Operations.
With financial restrictions on operations, technical work that scales will be limited and if you want to expand your scope beyond site manager, you'll end up back in the Corporate power game.
If you and your family are willing to live with the inconvenience of remote site life in the long run and you are happy to end your career as site manager, I suggest you reach for the hard hat.  

The main avenue of doing great work in the resources industry is to sell shovels.
When the California gold rush was analysed, they found that the people who made the most money were not the lucky ones who found the most gold, it was the suppliers, selling "shovels" to all the miners, whether they were lucky or not.  
	I believe this is still the case.
Resource companies are either lucky because the own rights to economically viable resources or they are big enough to buy the those rights from smaller lucky entities.  
	
Most of the successful supplier companies in the industry was founded by people doing great work for Operations, not Corporate.[^4]  
	There are two elements needed for any sort of to great work:   
	An important problem to solve and technology that can be applied to solve it.  
And there in lies the catch.
You will encounter the important problems to solve by spending time in Operations, 
but you will not get to learn technologies well enough there.   
	Corporate is a good place for getting generalist knowledge in technology while suppliers are a good place for specialist technology knowledge.
Between the corporate knowledge game, operations and supplier companies tThere are many opportunities to prepare for and do great work.  

To do good work in resources you need to understand the corporate-communist and operations-pauper dynamic.
Don't play corporate politics and align yourself with operations while finding ways to build your technology knowledge.
Then you will be in the position where curiosity will lead you to good work as supplier to operations. 
 
 	
[^1]: Some oil companies operate gas stations, but in practice they behave like business customers.
[^2]: Operatins staff either lives in small industrial towns or have the inconvenience of Fly In Fly Out (FIFO) rosters and camp accomodation.
[^3]: There are many meaningful ways to work in the resources industry that does not involve doing great work. Paul Graham defined great work as: "Doing something important so well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible." He described [How to do great work](https://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html) in an essay aimed at ambitious people, as is this essay. One of the core elements of Paul's essay is to work on "projects of your own".
[^5]: Well, there is the business of finding more resources and building expansions.
The purse strings are, as they should, looser for these activities.
I believe the people involved in the design of the "Operations" portions of projects are key to resources companies' success, but there are also many dollars wasted on "Corporate" elements of expansions. 
For the purposes of this essay, "Corporate" and "Operations" includes both the going-concern and expansion activities.
[^4]:Selling into non-rational markets is like selling Ferrari's.
There are much cheaper, more luxurious cars available that can also reach the speed limit on 99.99% of roads.
Yet people making Ferraris can still do great work by pushing the performance envelope (Operations), not by delivering to the non-rational sensibilities of those in the market for expensive sports cars.
