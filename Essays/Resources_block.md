# Doing great work behind the resources iron curtain

"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" Karl Marx famously remarked. 
This slogan would apply, he said in a world of abundance where "labour has become not only a means of life but life's prime want".  
	I believe that this world has become a reality in many resource-industry corporate offices, even in very capitalist countries.
These corporate workers certainly live in abundance and I would argue that as far as their labour is concerned, the means have become the end.  
	The distinction between workers in head office and those at the coal face is a lot more pronounced in the resources industry.
"Corporates" dwell in ultra liveable cities, while "Operations" have to put up with the harsh environments of the mine / processing plant / oil rig where the money is generated.[^2]
Operations are kept lean thanks to a share holder focus on cost per ton production, leaving the "abundance" in the hands of the Corporates.
That is probably true for most industries, but in other industries a lot of the effort of Corporates are directed at keeping customers happy.
Resources companies have few customers with few demands other than on-spec products being delivered on schedule.[^1]
With the two main business outcomes removed as focus, what drives activities / labour then but the "life's prime want" of the participants?[^5]   
	
With Marx's conditions met, these corporate environments foster the same tendencies that were observed in early communist societies.
Big projects with little correlation to the company's success are funded, patronage based empires are built and rivals are "purged" in rounds of lay-offs or "exiled" into dead-end roles.
These tendencies are less pronounced for smaller companies, but they are there.
	For people educated in technical and financial fields who expect decisions to be made based on facts only, this reality can be jarring. 
The question becomes how to do great work[^3] in this environment?  
	There are four options:  
1. You can stay in Corporate and "Play the game",
1. You can trade employment for a career in contracting where you act as a mercenary fighting for who ever is the winning side,
1. You can put your hard hat back on and join the lean Operations side of the business where you can stay clear of corporate politics, or
1. You can "sell shovels" and become a supplier of products or services into the resource industry.  

Playing the corporate game is about winning a popularity contest and that is not conducive to doing great work.
Without backing your projects will be canned, whether they are good or not. 
Like in high school, winning the popularity contents is a full time job and does not leave time for doing great work.
Contractors can also not do great work.[^4]
They get paid more on an hourly basis, but although they can work below the layer of most of the politics, they cannot work on their own projects.
Contractors have to work what their contract owner wants them work on and the contract owner is very much linked into corporate politics.  
	What about the hard hat?  
	I believe you can do great work of the "run a tight ship" variety in Operations.
The top job, site manager, places an upper limit to ambition for Operations.
With financial restrictions on operations, work that scales will be limited and if you want to expand your scope beyond site manager, you'll end up back in Corporate.
If you and your family are willing to live with the inconvenience of site long term and you are happy to end your career as site manager, I suggest you reach for the hard hat.  

The main avenue of doing great work in the resources industry is to sell shovels.
When the California gold rush was analysed, they found that the people who made the most money were not the lucky ones who found the most gold, it was the suppliers, selling shovels.
One can absolutely do great work building solutions to common needs in the resource industry, but how?  
	Most of the successful supplier companies in the industry was founded by people doing great work on products for Operations, but can you do great work selling shovels to Corporate?  
	Unless you are a race car driver, owning a Ferrari is not rational. 
There are much cheaper, more luxurious cars available that can also reach the speed limit on 99.99% of roads. 
Yet people making Ferraris can still do great work delivering to the non-rational sensibilities of those in the market for expensive sports cars.
I don't believe that these people focus on the buyer and their motivations for owning a Ferrari though. 
They are pushing the envelope of what the car is capable of at a high level of operations.  

So, to do do great work in the resources industry, you need to a product with an operations focus, even if your product is aiming at a level higher than your customers can practically attain.
Off course, the ideas for good-work-products will only be transparent in Operations.

	
[^1]: Some oil companies operate gas stations, but in practice they behave like business customers.
[^2]: Operatins staff either lives in small industrial towns or have the inconvenience of Fly In Fly Out (FIFO) rosters and camp accomodation.
[^3]: There are many meaningful ways to work in the resources industry that does not involve doing great work. Paul Graham defined great work as: "Doing something important so well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible." He described [How to do great work](https://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html) in an essay aimed at ambitious people, as is this essay. One of the core elements of Paul's essay is to work on "projects of your own".
[^4]: By contractors I mean staff augmentation roles where people fulfill "temporary" roles in corporota envirionmnets. I've seen peopl stay in the roles like this for over a decade.
[^5]: Well, there is the business of finding more resources and building expansions.
The purse strings are, as they should, looser for these activities.
I believe the people involved in the design of the "Operations" portions of projects are key to resources companies' success, but there are also many dollars wasted on "Corporate" elements of expansions. 
For the purposes of this essay, "Corporate" and "Operations" includes both the going-concern and expansion activities.
